## Abstract
The tutorial is in 'CNN_Recurrent.ipynb'. 
We also have python version for the project, and the file is 'CNN_Recurrent.py'.
There are two additional function in CNN_Recurrent.py
1. Add 'Changable hidden layers' in  Class RCNN, which means you can change the model sturcture by changing 'self.hidden layer'
2. Add 'plot result', which can show the loss vs epoch plot, and save it in ./data/WristSense/CNNs_HAR_and_HR.

And the datasets are in the ./data/WristSense/CNNs_HAR_and_HR/Data/wrist
The data was download from https://www.physionet.org/content/wrist/1.0.0/
